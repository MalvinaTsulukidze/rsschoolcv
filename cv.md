  I enjoy the whole process of learning new things about programming and I'm sure this course can help me to learn even more.
I feel like this is the best opportunity to improve my problem solving skill and to exercise my abilities. To be honest, at university, high grades 
(and subjects like: Academic Writing, Office Systems, Geoinformatics, that didn't interest me that much) were more importand for me than actual 
programming. I call freshman/sophomore years "wasted years" as a joke because of thatðŸ¤· Now that I'm a junior(technically senior in a few months, 4th year) 
I know what is my goal in programming and what do I need to achieve it!
